As part of the senior year curriculum at Tufts University, students participate in a Senior Design Class where teams of engineers complete projects. The design is open-ended and makes use of various elements of design, as well as use the student's knowledge of engineering science. I partnered with four other students to complete a project under the supervision of Tim Wennrich, a farmer from New Hamshipre.

## Meet the Team

## Ideation and Concept Generation

The first phrase we were given as a team was "Automatic Lettuce Grower"; however this idea developed after meeting with Tim. We were able to identify some of the key problems he faced on the farm and from there generated our first set of ideas.

We would then go on to narrow our ideas until we finally had 5 ideas, one each. My idea was an arm that can move on a linear rail. This arm would be capable of planting seeds and harvesting crops.

## Final Design

Our final design took components from each of the teams ideas and combined it in to one. The final functionality of the robot was...

* Seed Planting
* Soil Mositure Sensing
* Automatic Water

The arm is capable of inserting a needle into a bed of seeds and using a suction motor, it can pick up one of those seeds and deposit it into one of the pots. Also attached to the arm is a mositure sensor that when inserted into the soil can send readings back to a central computer. This computer can then determine the appropriate amount of water that pot needs. Then using a water basin and pump it can deliver water to the plants.

## My Contributions

Outside of the design process my major contribution to the team was on the coding side. I programmed the primary code for operating the robotic arm, in either an autonomous or tele-operated state. I also worked closely with Ronan Gissler on integrating the electrical components used.

## Future Work

In future iterations of this design I would like to focus my efforts particular in the area of user experience and repeatability. That includes

* Creating an app so the user can control the system from their phone
* Fine-Tuning the interface of the needle and soil sensor
* Setting up a system to detect if a seed has been picked up
