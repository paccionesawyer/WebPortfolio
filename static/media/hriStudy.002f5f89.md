## Situation and Task

In the Fall semester of my Senior Year I took a graduate level class on Human-robot Interaction. Human-robot interaction (HRI) sits at the intersection of psychology, human factors engineering, computer science, and robotics. The class took us through various case studies of developing robots for various societal tasks, from flexible and adaptive robots for industrial manufacturing, to socially assistive robots for elder care. Each student was responsible for short presentations on HRI studies and designs; work in interdisciplinary groups on a term project to design and conducting an HRI study.

The goal of my teams project was to understand how training a robot may impact how the user feels towards the robot. Having users train their robots may increase user attachment towards the robot as well as user understanding of how the robot learns to accomplish tasks.

## Action

To achieve our goal, we built two user friendly dog robots using LEGO SPIKE Prime kits and Raspberry Pis. Incorporating a Raspberry Pi with the LEGO hardware added more capabilities to our robot. We then implemented two different programs - one for the pre-trained dog robot and the other for the trainable robot. We designed a training algorithm that utilizes Reinforcement Learning by taking data from the sensors to update the probability that a certain action will occur in response to a participant’s voice command. When running this algorithm, the robot dogs were trained by participants to sit. The trained dog would respond to commands ‘down’, ‘stand’, ‘come’, or ‘spin’. From here, a novel social science study was run.

## My Contribution

I primarily worked on the reinforcement algorithm and the overall software design of the project.
